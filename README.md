# ZeanStore
E-Commerce store, with shopping cart, user/administrator login, product creation and modification. 
For the development backend, Java language was used with Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data and Spring Security, 
it also makes use of a MySQL database hosted on the clever-cloud server. For the frontend development, I worked with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.
